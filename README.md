## Introduction
In this document, I will discuss the transformation of our system from a traditional microservice-based CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) architecture to a CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation) pattern. This change was implemented to address various performance and scalability issues we faced in our old system. This documentation aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the process, the challenges encountered, and the benefits achieved.

## The Old System - CRUD
### Overview
Our old system was based on a microservice architecture where each microservice was responsible for both read and write operations for a specific part of the system.

### Problems Faced with CRUD
- **Performance Bottlenecks:** High read and write operations caused significant delays within individual microservices.
- **Scalability Issues:** Difficult to scale read and write operations independently due to their coupling within the same microservice.
- **Complex Business Logic:** Implementing and maintaining complex business logic in a single microservice was cumbersome and error-prone.

---

## Transition to CQRS
### Introduction to CQRS
CQRS stands for Command Query Responsibility Segregation. It is a design pattern that separates the responsibilities of handling command (write) operations and query (read) operations, allowing each to be optimized and scaled independently.

### Core Principles
- **Separation of Concerns:** Different models for reading and writing.
- **Event Sourcing:** Capturing all changes as a sequence of events.
- **Scalability and Performance:** Independent scaling of read and write operations.

## Designing the CQRS System
### Architecture Overview
The new system architecture is designed based on the CQRS pattern, with distinct components for handling commands and queries.

### Components
- **Message Broker:** Azure Service Bus, RabbitMQ, NServiceBus for communication.
- **Command Microservices:** Handle write operations and business logic.
- **Read Microservices:** Handle read operations and projections.
- **Event Store:** Stores events generated by write operations.
- **API Gateway:** Routes requests to appropriate microservices.
- **SignalR/WebSocket:** For real-time updates to connected web clients.

### Current Scale
- **Applications Managed:** Over 150,000
- **Events Processed:** Over 200 million
- **Concurrent Users:** Hundreds of concurrent users

## Implementation Details
### Steps Taken
1. **Message Broker:** Configured Azure Service Bus / Kafka for reliable messaging and eventual consistency.
2. **Command Microservices:** Developed multiple command microservices, each handling specific aggregates.
3. **Event Sourcing:** Implemented event sourcing for write operations using SQL Stream Store to capture all state changes.
4. **Projections:** Created projections in read microservices using Liquid Projections for efficient querying.
5. **API Gateway:** Used API Gateway to manage and route client requests.
6. **Real-time Updates:** Integrated SignalR/WebSocket for real-time client updates.

### Tools and Technologies Used
- **Azure Service Bus:** For messaging and integration events.
- **NServiceBus:** For handling message queues.
- **RabbitMQ:** As an alternative messaging broker.
- **SignalR/WebSocket:** For real-time data synchronization.
- **SQL Server:** For storing write and read data.
- **SQL Stream Store:** For event streaming.
- **Liquid Projections:** For creating read projections.

## Benefits Achieved
### Performance Improvements
- **Latency Reduction:** Significant reduction in latency due to optimized read and write operations.
- **Increased Throughput:** Higher transactions per second by decoupling read and write responsibilities.

### Scalability and Flexibility
- **Independent Scaling:** Ability to scale read and write microservices independently based on demand.
- **Modularity:** Easier to manage and deploy individual components.

### Consistency and Reliability
- **Eventual Consistency:** Better handling of consistency using event sourcing and service bus retries.
- **Reliability:** Improved system reliability with robust error handling and message retries.

### Real-time Data Updates
- **User Experience:** Enhanced user experience with real-time updates through SignalR/WebSocket.

## Tangible Results
### Quantitative Benefits
- **Performance Metrics:** Improved response time by 40%, increased transaction throughput by 30%.
- **Downtime Reduction:** Reduced system downtime and maintenance efforts

### Qualitative Benefits
- **Developer Productivity:** Improved productivity with clear separation of concerns.
- **System Maintainability:** Easier maintenance and updates due to modular architecture.
- **Stakeholder Satisfaction:** Positive feedback from stakeholders regarding system performance and reliability.

## Conclusion
### Summary
The transition from a CRUD-based microservice system to a CQRS architecture has significantly enhanced our system's performance, scalability, and reliability. By separating read and write operations and leveraging event sourcing, we have created a more robust and maintainable system.

### Future Enhancements
- **Further Optimizations:** Exploring further optimizations in event processing (NoSQL DB on the write side and SQL Server on the read side ?) and partial querying on the read side.
- **New Features:** Implementing additional features and enhancements based on user feedback.
